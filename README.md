* Data Story:
    - As rental income increases, sale prices remain mostly stable. For all neighborhoods, gross rent outpaced sales price per square foot. Neighborhoods with a steady sale price per square foot, or a sale price that decreases with respect to gross rent would be good investments. Hayes valley would be a good place to look at investment properties. The neighborhood's sales price is negatively correlated with average gross rent.
